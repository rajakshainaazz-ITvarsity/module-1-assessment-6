        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Oprah Winfrey and renowned brain development and trauma expert, Dr. Bruce Perry, 
            discuss the impact of trauma and adverse experiences and how healing must begin 
            with a shift to asking, 'what happened to you?' rather than 'what’s wrong with you?'
            <br><br>
            Through wide-ranging, and often deeply personal conversation, Oprah Winfrey and 
            Dr. Perry explore how what happens to us in early childhood – both good and bad - 
            influences the people we become. They challenge us to shift from focusing on, 
            'What’s wrong with you?' or “Why are you behaving that way?,” to asking, 'What 
            happened to you?' This simple change in perspective can open up a new and hopeful 
            understanding for millions about why we do the things we do, why we are the way we 
            are, providing a road map for repairing relationships, overcoming what seems 
            insurmountable, and ultimately living better and more fulfilling lives.
            <br><br>
            Many of us experience adversity and trauma during childhood that has a lasting 
            impact on our physical and emotional health. And as we’re beginning to understand, 
            we are more sensitive to developmental trauma as children than we are as adults. 
            ‘What happened to us’ in childhood is a powerful predictor of our risk for physical 
            and mental health problems down the road, and offers scientific insights into the 
            patterns of behaviors so many struggle to understand.
            <br><br>
            A survivor of multiple childhood challenges herself, Oprah Winfrey shares portions 
            of her own harrowing experiences because she understands the vulnerability that 
            comes from facing trauma at a young age. Throughout her career, Oprah has teamed 
            up with Dr. Bruce Perry, one of the world’s leading experts on childhood trauma. 
            He has treated thousands of children, youth, and adults and has been called on for 
            decades to support individuals and communities following high-profile traumatic events. 
            Now, Oprah joins forces with Dr. Perry to marry the power of storytelling with the science 
            and clinical experience to better understand and overcome the effects of trauma.
            <br><br>
            In conversation throughout the book, the two focus on understanding people, behavior, and 
            ourselves in the context of personal experiences. They remove blame and self-shaming, and 
            open up a space for healing and understanding. It’s a subtle but profound shift in our 
            approach to trauma, and it’s one that allows us to understand our pasts in order to clear 
            a path to our future - opening the door to resilience and healing in a proven, powerful way.
            <br><br>
            Grounded in the latest brain science and brought to life through compelling narratives, 
            this book shines a light on a much-needed path to recovery – showing us our incredible 
            capacity to transform after adversity.
